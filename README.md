## Credit_EDA
Credit_EDA is a machine learning project designed to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on credit-related data. The goal is to analyze, visualize, and understand credit datasets to uncover patterns and key features influencing credit risk. This project demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical insights, and classification model development to predict creditworthiness effectively.

## Features
1.Comprehensive exploratory data analysis including data visualization and summary statistics

2.Data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines

3.Feature engineering tailored for credit datasets

4.Implementation of classification algorithms to predict credit risk

5.Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

6.Insights into important features influencing credit decisions

## Built With
1.Python

2.Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

3.Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

4.Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

5.Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration
